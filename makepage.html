    <p>Sometime ago i noticed that calling multiple for/while loops can have a massive impact on performane in game. 
        But sometimes you really need those loops.
        My Solution: Opti Loop.
        Opti Loop uses Runservice and its stepped event to do the same as loops only with way less performance issues.
        On a test run i could run 100 loops and still have no issues with performance. 
        This ofcourse can be different for you depending on what code you're running in those loops.
